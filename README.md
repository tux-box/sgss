Steam Game Server as a Service
In this project we will do a few things.
1. setup vscode server for editing back end files while we setup and configure a functional web front end.
2. setup steam cmd for getting our game files from steam
3. setup a lamp stack for manageing the actual game server. In the future this same part will manage multiple servers?

Getting started.
